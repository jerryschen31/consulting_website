<p align="justify">I am a hands-on, passionate expert and leader in bioinformatics, and have established bioinformatics data pipelines, implemented both AWS cloud and on-premise compute and data storage environments, designed high-throughput sequencing assays, developed genomics databases, set up interactive genomics visualization tools, and performed data quality control, interpretation and analysis for many labs and companies over my 20 year career. For example, at Encoded Therapeutics, my bioinformatics and data infrastructure now supports over 150 employees and my analysis work directly contributed to over $300M in investor funding.
